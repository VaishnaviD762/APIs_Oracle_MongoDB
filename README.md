# APIs_Oracle_MongoDB

This document outlines a process of executing two Flask APIs: one for Oracle database interaction and another for MongoDB. The Oracle API enables users to execute SQL queries, fetch the results, convert them into an Excel file, and allow for download. Meanwhile, the MongoDB API retrieves specific data from MongoDB, processes it into a DataFrame, and exports it to an Excel file. Both APIs demonstrate Flask integration with database connectivity and data manipulation for Excel export.
